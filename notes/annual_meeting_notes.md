## Notes from Session

- Need to maintain longevity
- Arctic is different
- Need to define handbook [scope]
- Maybe include a glossary or quick guide.
  - E.g. distinguish Alaska Native from Native Alaskan
- It is a complex problem
- **What is the minimum to include**
- A way to capture the legacy of NNA
  - provide a historical context
- Kawarek research handbook is an example
  - Link to Kawarek document
  - Define success from an indigenous perspective
  - Define what is indigenous knowledge
  - [NNA handbook could] provide regional to inuit perspective
  - https://kawerak.org/natural-resources/research/
- What is available for other regions
- PDFs are a useful way to share information
- What kinds of questions we answer is based on perspective
  - Researcher -> specific
  - Community -> broad and complex
- Need humility
- Address:
  - how to communicate
  - how to build teams
- Need to balance the narrative
  - Not only problems but also success stories
- Main audience would be researchers
  - *But* this is a diverse set of disciplines and people
- Need to distinguish between Anchorage and rural Alaska
- Inuit do not have "dos and don'ts"  Community is too broad
